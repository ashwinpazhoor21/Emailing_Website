## Reflection
This project provided hands-on experience in building a web application with Django. It involved setting up a structured environment, managing static and dynamic content, and ensuring smooth operation through proper configuration. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of web development frameworks, front-end and back-end integration, and the importance of efficient data handling. The experience of developing an email application helped me grasp the complexities of user interface design and functionality similar to well-known platforms like Gmail.
